# PiCamLapse

Welcome to my project! This is my first ever Raspberry Pi project, and it will continue to evolve as I see new features to implement, and bugs to fix. Please feel free to contribute to this project. Anything is helpful, a simple issue, or a discussion topic. Please feel free, also, to use the issues section to request new features. 

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose to which I created this program was to take a single photo every day at solar noon (the point the sun is the highest in the sky) in order to make a timelapse video after 365 days have passed. At present the video creation functionality does not exist, but it is currently being worked on. This program has a lot of neat configurable options that you can change and tinker with for backing up your photos (and eventually your videos).

## To The User

Firstly, thank you for using my software! I truly appreciate it!

Secondly, this project is completely open source, so feel free to make any modifications that you wish. I only make one request, if you think your change or addition adds a much needed feature, fix, or improvement please put in a Pull Request and submit it. I would love any and all help in making this program even more functional.

Thirdly, if you aren't a programmer or are not familar with Python yet you still want to contribute please join in the discussion board and post any ideas or bugs you think of there, or use the issues section to post features or bugs that you find. I will be regularly checking both to try and resolve and explain solutions to these as often as I can. (After all, I do have a day job and this was a hobby project. But at very least, once a week.) I welcome any feedback!

And finally, please consult the Wiki on information to get everything you can out of this piece of software. Setup is, at present and unfortunately, laboreous. But the pay off is fantastic if you choose to use all of the features of this program. The wiki will be regularly updated anytime a feature is added or a bug is fixed. I will also have a section in the Wiki that will list all upcoming features I plan on implementing, and all known bugs (or general enhancements) I'm aware of and intend on fixing. If I have a bug listed and there is a work around, I will have that outlined in the section of known bugs as well. Also in the Wiki I will have a credits section for giving credit to all the creators who have either inspired me or aided in creating this program.

Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy!
